# rostoc-updates

Public workflow runner for Rostoc desktop builds. The private `alain1405/rostoc` repository dispatches CI and tagged release events to this repo so we can execute macOS/Windows builds on public runners and host updater artifacts via GitHub Pages.

## üîê Required secrets

| Secret                 | Scope                       | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PRIVATE_REPO_SSH_KEY` | Repository (rostoc-updates) | Deploy key with read access to the private `alain1405/rostoc` repo so the build workflow can clone sources.                                                                                     |
| `UPDATES_REPO_TOKEN`   | Both repos                  | Personal access token with `repo` scope. In `rostoc-updates` it uploads release assets back to the private repo; in `alain1405/rostoc` it dispatches the workflows and polls for their results. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow flow

1. **Push / PR in private repo** ‚Äì `ci-build.yml` fires a `trigger-ci` dispatch and exits immediately. The public `Dispatch CI Build` workflow reports its result back to the private repo via the status context `rostoc-updates/ci`.
2. **Tag in private repo** ‚Äì `trigger-public-build.yml` fires `trigger-release` and exits. The public release workflow builds signed artifacts, publishes `latest.json`, re-uploads the tarball/signature, and sets the status context `rostoc-updates/release`.

If either side is missing the shared secrets, the dispatch/workflows will fail fast with actionable logs.

## ‚úÖ Branch protection checklist

- Require commit status **`rostoc-updates/ci`** on the main branch (and any long-lived release branches) so merges only pass after the public CI workflow succeeds.
- Optionally require **`rostoc-updates/release`** for tag protection to ensure signed builds finish before the release is published.
- (Optional) Add a README badge pointing at the public workflow if you want a visible signal; the protected status already does the heavy lifting.
