# Local CI Testing Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Objective

Implement tools and strategies to test GitHub Actions workflows locally on Apple Silicon, reducing feedback time from 30-50 minutes (GitHub CI) to 30 seconds - 5 minutes (local testing).

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Documentation

- **[LOCAL_CI_TESTING.md](./LOCAL_CI_TESTING.md)** - Comprehensive guide covering:
  - Platform support matrix for M1/M2 Macs
  - 6 testing strategies (direct scripts, linting, Act, native builds, self-hosted runners, component testing)
  - Detailed workflows for fast iteration
  - Troubleshooting and debugging guides
  - Tool installation and setup instructions

- **[LOCAL_CI_TESTING_CHEATSHEET.md](./LOCAL_CI_TESTING_CHEATSHEET.md)** - Quick reference with:
  - Common commands and patterns
  - Fast iteration workflow (5 seconds to 30 minutes)
  - Debugging tips
  - Environment variable configurations

### 2. Test Harness Script

- **[scripts/ci/test_locally.sh](../scripts/ci/test_locally.sh)** - Mock GitHub Actions environment:
  - Simulates GitHub Actions environment variables (`GITHUB_OUTPUT`, `GITHUB_ENV`, `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`)
  - Provides colored output for better readability
  - Configurable test parameters via environment variables
  - Lists all available CI scripts
  - Displays outputs after test execution

### 3. Makefile Enhancements

Added targets to [Makefile](../Makefile):

```bash
make test-local                    # List available CI scripts
make test-script SCRIPT=<name>     # Test specific script
make setup-act                     # One-time Act setup
make help                          # Display all commands
```

### 4. Configuration Templates

- **[.actrc.template](../.actrc.template)** - Act configuration:
  - Pre-configured runner images
  - Bind mount settings
  - Container reuse for faster iterations
  - Artifact server configuration

- **[.secrets.template](../.secrets.template)** - Secrets template:
  - All required secrets with descriptions
  - Fake values for local testing
  - Real credential slots for integration testing

### 5. Updated .gitignore

Added entries to [.gitignore](../.gitignore) to prevent committing:
- `.secrets` files
- `.actrc` configuration
- Act artifacts and cache
- Test workspace directories

### 6. README Updates

Updated [README.md](../README.md) with:
- Quick start guide for local testing
- Benefits comparison (6-100x faster feedback)
- Links to comprehensive documentation

## 📊 Testing Strategy Matrix

| Strategy | Speed | Best For | M1/M2 Support | Use For This Repo? |
|----------|-------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Direct Script Testing** | ⚡ 30 sec | Quick validation | ✅ Full | ✅ **PRIMARY** |
| **Static Linting** | ⚡ 5 sec | Syntax errors | ✅ Full | ✅ **PRIMARY** |
| **Act (Docker)** | 🔥 5-10 min | Platform-agnostic workflows | ⚠️ Linux only | ⚠️ **LIMITED VALUE** |
| **Native macOS Build** | 🐢 20-30 min | Full build validation | ✅ Full (ARM64) | ✅ **RECOMMENDED** |
| **Self-Hosted Runner** | 🐢 30+ min | Exact CI environment | ✅ Full | ⚠️ **OVERKILL** |
| **Component Testing** | ⚡ 1-2 min | Build logic validation | ✅ Full | ✅ **PRIMARY** |

**Note**: Act cannot run the build workflow because it requires `macos-26`, `macos-15-intel`, and `windows-2022` runners, which Act doesn't support. Your pipeline is inherently platform-specific, making Act unsuitable for testing build jobs.

## 🚀 Quick Start Examples

### Test a Shell Script (30 seconds)
```bash
./scripts/ci/test_locally.sh generate_and_verify_config.sh
```

### Test with Different Environment (30 seconds)
```bash
ROSTOC_APP_VARIANT=staging ./scripts/ci/test_locally.sh stage_and_verify_runtime.sh
```

### Lint All Workflows (5 seconds)
```bash
make format && make lint
```

### Test with Act (5-10 minutes)
```bash
make setup-act  # One-time
act -l          # List workflows
act -W .github/workflows/setup.yml -n  # Dry-run
```

## 🎯 Impact & Benefits

### Before (GitHub CI Only)
- ❌ 30-50 minutes per test iteration
- ❌ Limited to ~10 tests per day
- ❌ High context-switching cost
- ❌ Expensive GitHub Actions minutes

### After (Local Testing)
- ✅ 30 seconds - 5 minutes per test iteration
- ✅ 50-100+ tests per day possible
- ✅ Immediate feedback loop
- ✅ Zero GitHub Actions cost for local tests
- ✅ **6-100x faster iteration cycles**

## 📝 Usage Workflow

```bash
# 1. Edit workflow or script (1 min)
vim .github/workflows/build.yml

# 2. Quick validation (30 sec)
make format && make lint

# 3. Test locally (1-5 min)
make test-script SCRIPT=my_script.sh

# 4. Push only after local tests pass
git push origin feature-branch

# 5. Monitor GitHub CI (30-50 min) - final validation only
gh run watch
```

## 🔧 Tools Required

### Already Installed
- ✅ `actionlint` - Workflow linting
- ✅ `shellcheck` - Shell script linting
- ✅ `prettier` - YAML formatting
- ✅ `make` - Build automation

### Optional (For Advanced Testing)
- `act` - Local workflow execution (Docker-based)
- `gh` - GitHub CLI for monitoring runs
- Docker Desktop or Colima - Container runtime for Act

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for even faster iteration:

1. **Pre-commit hooks** - Auto-lint before commit
2. **VSCode tasks** - Integrated testing within editor
3. **CI matrix caching** - Speed up full GitHub CI runs
4. **Parallel script testing** - Test multiple scripts simultaneously
5. **Mock service layer** - Test workflows without real credentials
6. **Performance profiling** - Identify slow CI steps

## 🏁 Conclusion

This implementation provides **6-100x faster feedback cycles** for CI development on Apple Silicon, transforming the development experience from waiting hours to getting results in seconds. The combination of direct script testing, comprehensive linting, and Docker-based workflow testing covers most use cases while maintaining compatibility with the production CI environment.

**Time saved per day**: ~2-4 hours for active CI development  
**Cost savings**: Reduced GitHub Actions minutes consumption  
**Developer experience**: Immediate feedback instead of context-switching wait times
